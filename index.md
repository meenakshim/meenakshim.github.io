## Meenakshi Mani
### PhD Candidate in Education, Ex-Software Engineer

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/author.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Meenakshi Mani" style="width: 25%;">

I am a 3rd year PhD candidate within the Centre for Research in Digital Education at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests lie broadly in the intersection of AI and education.

Prior to joining the University of Edinburgh, I completed my M.A in Educational Foundations, Policy & Practice from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I also hold a bachelors and master’s degree in computer science, and previously worked as a software engineer in the tech industry for ten years. 

I grew up in India and lived in the U.S for over a decade before moving to the U.K for my PhD. The cities of Cochin, Chennai, Boulder and Seattle hold a special place in my heart.
