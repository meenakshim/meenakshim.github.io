## The Making of Machine Learning in education (2022 – present)

The goal of this research project is to present a more complete picture of how AI techniques such as machine learning are leveraged to enhance classroom learning experiences for students in K-12 classrooms. I aim to examine the practices, discourses and environments through which AI education technologies (EdTech) for K-12 education are developed. This will involve an original study of the algorithmic foundations and processes involved in the creation of AI technologies for education, and of the practices and assumptions of the engineers who create these education technologies.There are two main objectives:

1.  Understand how classroom realities are being coded and captured by machine learning algorithms. This includes investigating the technical facets of building machine learning models such as feature engineering and model fine-tuning.

2. Understand how working within a technological milieu influences education technology software engineers’ conceptualization of learning and pedagogy, as well as their ability to ask critical questions of the algorithms they build.

## Investigating the Summit Learning Platform (2021 – 2022)
Between May 2021 and May 2022, I worked as a student researcher in the National Education Policy Center (NEPC), part of the University of Colorado, Boulder. I was part of an investigative research project focused on the Summit Public Schools (SPS) charter network and its digital education platform, the Summit Learning Platform (both of which have close ties with the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative). My core contributions were to organize and drive the analysis of close to 100 documents the NEPC received from SPS in response to NEPC’s public records access request. My contributions included:

1. Designing an organizational structure to keep track of all of the documents provided, allow easy access to the generated research and enable quick re-tracing of the generated research back to the source.

2.  In-depth analysis of the Summit Public Schools curriculum, with the goal of investigating the claims related to their innovative nature of student learning.

3. In-depth breakdown of legal contracts that Summit Public Schools has with third-party services integrated into the Summit Learning Platform with the goal of highlighting language related to student data handling, student privacy, and associated liabilities.
